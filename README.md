## The Cat Database

For this project, I decided to create a web application that has information about 27 different breeds of cats. Users can use a search bar to type in the name of a particular cat, or they can use the buttons on the home page to navigate to the page of a particular breed. It should be noted that to correctly use the search bar, the user must correctly spell the breed's name and capitalize the first letter, and add any special characters if necessary. For instance, if a user wants to search for the Balinese-Javanese, they would need to type in "Balinese-Javanese" exactly.

Once on the web page for a particular breed, users will be greeted by a page displaying the name of the breed, an image of the breed, and a short description. They can use a button to navigate back to the home page, or edit/delete the existing description of a particular cat. If they want to restore this description, they can use the restore button.
